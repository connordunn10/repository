Chime: Online banking for the Future
====================================


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chime, the online personal banking platform, was envisioned and started by Chris Britt CEO & Ryan King CTO in 2013. There is little to no information from the Chime co-founders as to how they came up with the idea to become an alternative banking company. On their website’s mission statement, it states that they “created Chime because [they] believe everyone deserves financial peace of mind” in order to “members get ahead by making managing money easy” (Chime).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 10/26/2020, Chime is reported to be valued at $14.5 billion and raised over $1 billion. Built In San Francisco, an online community, also details that Chime is funded by “leading investors including DST, Coatue, Tiger Global, General Atlantic, Iconiq, Dragoneer, Menlo, Whale Rock, Access, Forerunner …and others” (builtinsf.com). Many of such are technology centric venture capital investors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbes “Chime Review-The Pros and Cons” indicates how Chime solving inherent issues in personal banking through the simplification of account options “with one checking account, one savings account and one secured credit card,” all of which is presented on one mobile app. In an attempt to disrupt the traditional banking system, each of the previously mentioned accounts do away with the burdensome constraint of fees, lack of automated savings and a required credit score to open an account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many brick-and-mortar banks that charge account fees, Chime’s checking account, referred to as the Spending Account, does not charge fees on a monthly basis with the added bonus of no minimum balance obligations. This checking account in turn puts more money in the Chime member’s pocket for expenditures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for saving money, the savings account on Chime has two options which are called the “Save When You Spend” and “Save When I Get Paid” features. On a Chime debit card, the Save When You Spend feature is an automated system that rounds the remaining cents up to the nearest dollar after an expenditure, and then transfers those cents from one’s spending to savings account. So, if one were to spend $10.50 on their debit card, Chime’s algorithm will instantly move the $0.50 from their spending to their savings account. In total, that member will have spent $11 on their transaction, but redirected the 50 cents to their other account. The Save When I Get Paid feature gives the member the option to automatically transfer 10% of their paycheck of $500 or more from the Spending Account to the Savings Account. Instead of personally having to transfer one’s money into savings like many traditional banks, Chime has its algorithms do so for the member. Also important to note is that Chime’s “savings account offers a 1.00% annual percent yield (APY)” (“Chime Review-The Pros and Cons”). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chime is changing the way people apply for credit cards as well. Many credit card companies require a certain credit score level and a minimum security deposit in order to meet the criteria to obtain an account On Chime’s website, they offer a Chime Credit Builder visa credit card that boasts no credit check and no minimum security deposit.Once a member begins spending this credit card, each month their Spending Account will automatically payoff their balance to ensure that the member’s credit score does not decrease.
According to Chime CEO Chris Britt, their target market is focused “on millennials who make $35,000 to $70,000 a year, people who may be frustrated by fees at their brick-and-mortar lenders” (Son, 2019). A reason for their 4 million customers and counting is how their zero APY, zero APR, little to none out-of-pocket fees and no required credit score for application has allowed for people in this income bracket, who are typically new to credit and balancing their budget, to get more purchasing power out of their income.  
<p>Although the app’s features and display look to be simple and straightforward, the technologies used for developing, implementing and archiving all of Chimes operations and data are not so simple. Since Chime is a private company with limited public information, the financial technologies used are found in their Job Openings website page.The Analytic team builds metric frameworks and uses monitoring through the Python and R languages to understand user behavior. A Chime data engineer needs experience in SQL databases, such as MySQL and Prtgres, to manage users accounts, deposits, money transfers, withdrawals,etc., through data integrity and transaction processing so that money is validated and accounted for throughout Chimes data system.  Data Science and Machine Learning data scientists/engineers use “ML/DL/NLP toolkits: Kera, PyTorch, Tensorflow, sckrit-learn, SparkML,spaCy, etc.” in order to construct machine learning solutions that operate at scale.There are many other programs, languages, databases, and more for their employees in the Design, Engineering, DevOps, etc. teams. All of these employees simultaneously create the secure and easily manageable online banking experience through financial technology tools.
<p>Essentially, Chime is in the domain of personal finance/Deposits/Online banking. Within the online banking domain, many companies have been using financial technology to simplify their user experience, make their accounts more secure through cyber security and prevent random interferences for their customers in the last decade or so. One of the most recent and prevalent innovations in this domain is how online banks implement AI to “consolidate all internal and external data, building predictive profiles of customers and members in real time” (Marous). Due to the myriad of data available, online banks implementing AI will not only be able to provide customers with simplified and less expensive banking, but be able to to give “next-best actions” for one’s finances. This will eventually evolve into creating value for stocks and investments as well, ultimately eliminating financial advisors and some stock brokers. Of this domain, there are a multitude of companies vying to push into the established banks market. Besides Chime, the most popular, online banks such as Dave, Ally, Varo Money, BankMobile, aspiration, MoneyLion, and more have the most customers in this domain (“The Online Bank Insurgency Of 2020”).
<p>Chime has been carving out its own niche in the banking community. While the biggest in terms of customers in FinTech online banking, their “4 million customer number is far fewer than the more than 50 million digital accounts at J.P. Morgan and 37 million at Bank of America” (Son). Growth in the banking market poises difficulties for traditional banks to catch up with the nuances of online banks. Online banks use company valuation, number of accounts and the amount of money invested by customers to measure the companies core metrics success. Chime is leading the way for online banks in the number of accounts and company valuation compared to competitors.
<p>Chime has many great features, but they could improve by implementing a feature to allocate budgeting and spending into categories so that the customer can see where their money is going towards, like how PocketGuard does so. In doing so, Chime would make personal banking much more attractive to customer and likely pull in additional customers. Also, Chime should find a way to have more ATMs available, without an ATM fee. Dave has nearly double the available ATMs that Chime does. If Chime used AI to create value for members by giving them a heads up on how they might do better with their finances or investments, they could take an even larger control of the online banking market. Ultimately, AI would take the place of financial advisors or investment managers. Finally, Chime should look into partnering with Venmo or PayPal, so that customers can transfer money to more people, rather than just Chime-based peer-to-peer payments. This would help create a larger market share for Chime by introducing more people to the bank while making payments and transfers for Chime members easier.
